# CO468 - Computer Vision Assignment - 2
## Deep Learning
Implement a deep learning model for X-Ray image classification

## Overview
- Submission on: 8th June, 2020
- The code directory contains the codes for all the models used. The nomenclature used is that the name of the code is same as the SNo of the model in the report. Ex. Ensemble of DenseNet and Xception trained using transfer learning with weighted loss function has SNo 15 and its corresponding code is Model-15.ipynb.
- The results directory contains the confusion matrix and classification report obtained by running every model on the test data.
- Best model is given as .h5 file and it corresponds to DenseNet + Xception model trained using transfer learning with weighted loss function.
- The presented report describes the model architecture as well as the analysis of the results.
 
## Installation
- The following codes are of the form of IPython notebooks and have been compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS with Anaconda, Python 3.7 and tensorflow version 2.2.0-rc3 installed.
- Make sure you have installed both of them on your PC.
